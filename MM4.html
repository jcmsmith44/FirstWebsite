	<p>Placing Mega Man 4 at 7th on my list, being the only Mega Man game to crack my top 10, will no doubt stir up some controversy if any NES enthusiasts happen across these rankings.  It is widely considered one of the worst of the original 5 Mega Man games.  The funny part is, I really don't have a great excuse for it.  I didn't get into Mega Man games in a big way until the X series on SNES, and Mega Man 4 was simply the only one I ever finished for some reason.  It was still fairly difficult, but not near as difficult as some of the other original 5.  I ranked it fairly low for quality as well since it didn't really introduce any new features to Mega Man's arsenal of abilities and wasn't as well received as many of the other Mega Man games.</p>

	<p>Additionally, I have the speedrun for Mega Man 4 rated as my lowest on this list.  This is due to the fact that I jsut don't really know much about NES Mega Man speedrunning in general.  I'm not inspired to run them and, other than Mega Man and Mega Man 2, have pretty sparse communities as far as I know.  What really put this game into the top 10 for me is the nostalgia factor.  I have mentioned many reasons this game shouldn't be on the list, but at the end of the day, I do have very fond memories of playing this game as a child, more than any other Mega Man game for the NES.  Although it is most certainly clouded by my nostalgia bias, I have to put it at 7.</p>
