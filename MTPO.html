	<p>Coming in at 8th in the countdown, we have the only sports game to make the list: Mike Tyson's Punch.  This is another game that would probably be higher on the list if the nostalgia-factor was a bit higher, but it's another one I never owned growing up.  Although I did play this game many times throughout my childhood at friends houses or renting it from the local grocery store, it is the only game other than Metroid that I never beat as a child.  In fact, even after returning to the game as an adult, it remains the only game on this list that I simply am not able to finish.  The timing and memorization it takes to finish those last few fights is insanely brutal.  That vaults Punch-Out to the top of the list for difficulty by default.</p>

	<p>As far as quality goes, Punch-Out is pretty widely considered one of the two best, if not THE best sports game for the NES accompanying Tecmo Bowl at the top of the heap with a wide gap to the rest of the pack.  The 8-bit reality of the NES just made it very difficult for sports games to translate well to the console, but Mike Tyson's Punch-Out did it better than any of the others.  Unique, menacing opponents, crisp controls, and charming artwork combined to tell an effective underdog story through the medium of a video game with an unparalleled sense of accomplishment for finally putting Tyson on the mat for the 10-count.  Accordingly, Punch-out has quite an active and dedicated speedrunning community.  As hard as the game is to play casually, the speedrun makes the casual experience seem easy, at it is almost all pattern memorizations and split-second reactions with a health amount of run-killing RNG mixed in.  It comes in relatively low in the speedrun category because I have never played the run and I don't enjoy watching it as much as some of the other runs on this list.</p>
