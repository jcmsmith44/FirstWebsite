	<p>Standing tall at #1 overall is, in my opinion, the most revolutionary game of all time: The Legend of Zelda for the NES.  This game was another very early release, debuting in January 1987.  It suffers in popular opinion due to the simplistic nature of the top-down world and the difficulty of combat and merely finding your way around the world.  I strongly disagree with most of the common criticism of this game as I believe most of the things people criticize are exactly what gives this game its charm.  It allowed the player to explore the world and do things at their own pace, with the equipment they had found to that point.  Players would get all the way to the boss of a dungeon and realize they missed the necessary equipment to kill the boss, and be forced to explore the world further.  It was also the first game ever to utilize save files instead of passwords in order to continue your journey from where you left off last time, which was much more convenient and became the standard for games going forward.</p>

	<p>I played this game more than any game on this list other than Trog, and have years of fond memories of time spent exploring Hyrule.  This was a before the the internet where, if you get stuck in a video game, you can just look up where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do.  It took hundreds of hours to find the correct paths through the game and hundreds of deaths to finish all of the dungeons.  Speaking of the dungeons, while this game isn't quite as difficult as a few of the games on this list due to the upgrades available which make the game much easier, first you have to find those upgrades and, even when every single sword and defense upgrade is found, this game is no walk in the park.  The enemies are powerful and relentless in the later dungeons, which serve as giant mazes to try and navigate, trapping you in rooms with powerful enemies that you can't escape without killing them all.  Furthermore, once you finally fire a silver arrow into Ganon and save Princess Zelda, the game essentially tells you that everything you have just done was a warmup for the REAL game.  It then starts you on a completely new quest.  The overworld is mostly the same, but the game gives you fewer resources, moves a few of the cave locations, and moves all of the dungeons to new locations on the overworld.  Once you do manage to find the better-hidden dungeons, good luck navigating them, as they are different shapes, have far more convoluted paths to navigate, and have far more nasty rooms with powerful enemies.</p>

	<p>The speedrun of this game is the final push that propelled this game to the top of my list.  It is by far my favorite game to run for multiple reasons.  First, there are so many different categories that you can run.  While 1st quest any% is the most popular (which means you can complete the game with no stipulations), it has 100%, Swordless, and my personal favorite, Low% for both quests.  As I'm sure I've made clear by now, I really enjoy a challenge, and Low% requires you to complete the game without getting any item that isn't necessary to complete the game.  That means: no extra hearts, no sword upgrades, no armor upgrades, no potions, etc.  This is the game that really got me into speedrunning through the randomizer racing community.  Like I mentioned previously, there is a community dedicated to racing The Legend of Zelda after a program has randomized the game in whatever ways they want.  Had I not seen these races randomly on YouTube, I never would have decided to give speedrunning a try.  For all of these reasons, The Legend of Zelda is my favorite NES game of all time!</p>
