	<p>At #6 we have the game that transformed gaming forever, Super Mario Bros.  Super Mario Bros. is the quintessential NES game, platforming at its purest form.  This game gets high marks for quality as it revolutionized gaming controls, introducing the momentum mechanic and nailing it better than many games that would follow it.  The speedrun is also positive for Super Mario Bros, which boasts the most active, popular speedrunning community of any NES game in the entire library.  It is also probably the most optimized run in the NES library, and possibly of any mainstream console game.  At the time of writing, the top 5 runners in the world are separated by less than 4/5 of a second, and the top 105 runners are separated by less than 5 seconds!  I didn't grade the speedrun higher because I haven't ever run the game and I don't believe I ever will, given the insane amount of optimization it takes to achieve a top 100 time.</p>

	<p>For me, Super Mario Bros. falls a bit short in the areas of nostalgia and difficulty.  Because the game is so short and you are able to quite easily warp to the last world of the game, I didn't spend near as much time playing this game as I did others on this list.  For that reason, the nostalgia score suffers.  Many find this game to be decently difficult and, compared to modern games, that may be true.  However, when compared to most games on this list and many others that didn't make the list, this game just doesn't hold a candle to the brutality that NES games can offer.  It ranks 9th out of the top 10 for difficulty and 6th overall.</p>
