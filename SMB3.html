	<p>Widely considered the pinnacle of the NES library, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes in just one spot shy of the top spot on my list.  The quality of this game is impossible to ignore.  It is the highest quality game ever produced for the NES and I don't believe many would dispute that claim.  Creative level/world design, unique enemies, vivid backgrounds, and impeccable controls made this game a masterpiece, putting the capabilities of the NES on full display.  I, just like almost all of my friends, played this game a ton growing up.  Nintendo even produced an entire movie called "The Wizard" starring Fred Savage to promote its release!  Due to the massive popularity of this game in its day, it has a very active speedrunning community.  In addition, the run itself is very fun to watch; especially the "Warpless" and "100%" categories that require the runner to play through most/all of the game rather than just warping to the end of the game from world 1.</p>

	<p>The one category that blemishes this game for me is the difficulty.  While Mario 3 certainly isn't near the bottom of the pack for difficulty relative to the entire NES library, it is definitely the easiest game on my list.  This game was released toward the tail-end of the NES's lifespan.  By that time, Nintendo had receieved criticism for the brutal difficulty of many of their games.  In a move to pull in more casual players, the developers of Super Mario Bros 3 added several mechanics in an effort to make the game much more forgiving.  The game allows you to earn and stockpile powerups that can be used before levels to make them easier.  If you do happen to lose a few lives, it's generally not a huge concern, as the game is VERY generous with the amount of extra lives it makes available.  Furthermore, if you do lose all your lives, it sends you back to the start of the current world you are in, unlike many previous NES titles that sent you back to the beginning of the entire game.</p>
