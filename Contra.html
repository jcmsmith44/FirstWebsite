	<p>We have arrived at #3 on my top 10 countdown with Contra.  Although it is my bronze medal recipient, I will start by mentioning that I believe this game's difficulty is notoriously overstated, Konami-code (30 lives code) notwithstanding.  While it's certainly not the easiest game in the NES library, I routinely see Contra placed in list of top 10 most difficult NES games of all time, ahead of some of the most grueling games the NES has to offer; games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Zelda 2, Kid Icarus, and even Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.  I have rated Contra much more modestly on the difficulty scale than most at a modest 7.  I will provide full disclosure here, I have watched the speedrun and run this game myself quite a bit, which is why I gave it the 4th spot in the speedrun rankings.  However, I was beating this game without the extra lives code easily as a kid when I couldn't even get near the Mike Tyson fight in Punch-Out or get to the 4th palace in Zelda 2.</p>

	<p>The quality of Contra is very strong, mirroring my overall rating at #3.  It is a short, simple game with only 8 levels that go by pretty quick, but that's all it needs to be.  It has very crisp controls, creative stages with vivid backgrounds, clean hitboxes, and a very fun experience overall.  You have a wide variety of gun upgrades you can choose from littered throughout the 8 stages of the game, but when you die, you go back to your basic weapon, losing any upgrades you have acquired.  Accordingly, I spent a lot of hours playing this game as a kid.  It might have been even higher on the nostalgia scale if it wasn't so short and I wasn't able to beat it so easily.</p>
