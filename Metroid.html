	<p>We start the countdown with at #10 with Metroid.  Now, if you were to simply look at the individual ratings I gave this game and compare them to the overall rank being the last of all the games in my top 10, you may wonder how it isn't a bit higher.  To answer that question, I have to confess that one individual attribute tends to affect my biases a bit more than the others, especially at the bottom and top ends of the countdown.  I never owned Metroid growing up.  In fact, the first time I ever played Metroid was as part of a randomizer that combines Metroid and Zelda into one completely randomized game in which the player can move between the two games and find Metroid items in Zelda and vice-versa.  I had never even seen the game played until a little over a year ago.  For those reasons, Metroid got the lowest nostalgia score of all the games by a large margin, and I just couldn't bring myself to put it above any others for my personal list.  Despite being on the bottom of my top 10 list, Metroid is one of the most overlooked and underrated games for the NES.</p> 

	<p>Widely panned as one of the worst games in the series by fans of the later, more widely popular titles in the series, such as Super Metroid and Metroid Prime, Samus Aran's original adventure is over-criticized and under-appreciated in my opinion. The game was a relatively early title for the NES, with an August, 1986 release.  Developers were still learning how to best take advantage of capabilities of the NES.  While I do understand many of the criticisms of this game, such as somewhat sloppy controls, convoluted upgrade locations, and the potential for the game to be extremely difficult, I also think they are overblown in many cases.  The controls weren't as messy as many games of the time.  There were many items hidden in places you wouldn't think to look at first, but that was the point.  The developers wanted the player to explore.  Depending on the amount of exploration the player did and how many upgrades the player found, they could decide whether they wanted to make the treacherous corridors and nasty boss fights easier with more exploration/upgrades or extremely difficult with minimal exploration.</p>
