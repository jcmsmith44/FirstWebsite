	<p>Remember way back when I said nostalgia would carry a bit heavier weight than some of the other criteria at the extremes of the spectrum?  Well, Trog!, a game many retro/NES enthusiasts have never even heard of, comes in at #4 on my list on the back of its nostalgia and speedrun ratings it carries for me.  I played this game more as a child than any other game on the list.  I played it with my brothers, my mom, and my friends at almost any available opportunity.  My love for this game did not wane later in life, either.  At the time of writing, I have the world record in most speedrun categories for this game (not that competition is especially heated).</p>

	<p>Trog! can best be described as Pac-Man but, instead of ghosts and... whatever Pac-Man is, you get cave-men chasing around dinosaurs who are trying to collect their eggs.  The game is quite simple and repetitive, finding itself a bit out of its league when compared to the other games on this list as far as quality is concerned.  It's also not all that difficult.  Don't get me wrong, you probably won't beat this game on your first few attempts.  However, after learning patterns and safer paths through the levels, most casual players should be able to tackle this one.  Despite the relative lack in quality and difficulty, my deeply held bias is too much to ignore, vaulting Trog! to #4 on the countdown.</p>
