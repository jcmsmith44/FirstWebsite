	<p>At #5 on my list, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is another game that I feel is a victim of popular opinion favoring other games in the franchise.  It was famously featured on one of the first episodes of the Angry Video Game Nerd YouTube series.  Many people hate this game, and I can understand why they feel that way.  I gave this game an 8 for quality because the controls do feel cumbersome to an extent in this game and the 4 turtles you can play as are incrdibly unbalanced.  Donatello is by far the best turtle and pretty much everyone else just serves as a meat-shield for tanking damage throughout really difficult parts of the game.  Speaking of the difficult parts of the game, that is basically every part of the game after the first two areas.  It really kicks off with the infamous dam-level and doesn't look back.  Precision jumps, brutal enemies, and instant death gauntlets abound.  You only get 2 continues and you will most likely need them as there are NO extra lives in this game.  The closest you can get is saving one turtle in a specific area of the game that is longer and harder to get to than taking the normal path.</p>

	<p>While I rated TMNT at #9 for the speedrun, it's not because I don't enjoy watching it; it is a very entertaining run to watch.  However, I would never be masochistic enough to run this game and it doesn't have a very active speedrunning community.  It is one of the more difficult speedruns on the NES in my opinion and is HEAVILY gated by RNG in the final area of the game.  The final level of the game is randomly place in one of the locations deep in the final main area of the game.  The enemies in this area are incredibly powerful and difficult to dodge.  Not only do you have to make it through these gauntlets of enemies alive, but you also have to pray that the final level is waiting for you at the end. Conveniently, the quickest and easiest location to check is the least likely location for the level entrance to spawn.  So if you do happen to make it all the way to this point on pb-pace, it's highly likely you will have to reset when you don't find the final level on your first try.  I put this game at #5 because I do have very fond memories of playing this game and failing over and over again for years before finally finishing off Shredder at the end and feeling more satisfaction than I have ever experienced from simply finishing a video game.</p>
