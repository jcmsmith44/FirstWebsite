	<p>Of all of the Zelda games ever made, Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link is pretty widely placed toward the bottom of the list for most people.  Indeed, it's certainly not the greatest Zelda title ever produced and was overshadowed by the all-time greats that came directly before and after it.  However, I give Zelda 2 much more credit than many.  Let's first address the criticisms.  Zelda 2 suffers from some muddy controls, a simplistic overworld, and the repetitive nature of the experience grinding any non-prodigy would need to do to beat the game.  The palaces are all bland and incredibly confusing. Everything looks the same, and there is no map, so you can never tell where you are without memorizing the layout of the entire dungeon and, believe me, that would take a LONG time and a lot of patience for some of the later palaces.  But I have to give the developers credit.  They took a massive risk on the heels of a highly successful outing with The Legend of Zelda by deciding to change Zelda 2 from a top-down adventure to mainly a side-scroller.  Unfortunately, it didn't pay off as well as they had hoped and they reverted back to the top-down style for their next couple games that would go on to be two of the most beloved titles in the franchise: "A Link to the Past" for the SNES and "Link's Awakening" for Gameboy.</p>

	<p>While I have said repeatedly that I like extremely difficult games, there is such a thing as being too difficult for your intended audience, and I can recognize that.  Zelda 2 is one of the most difficult titles ever released for the NES and is certainly the most difficult Zelda game of all time.  ***Spoiler Alert*** While I do find Punch-Out to be more difficult than Zelda 2 purely based on mechanics, Punch-Out was simple in what it required of you and the game was relatively short.  It was a massive challenge to get through a very short game.  Zelda 2 was an incredibly long, confusing game, and it seemed that everything the developers put in the game; every enemy, every mechanic, every item block the player encountered, was meant to frustrate the player to the point of smashing their television with a hammer.  That being said, I gave up on this game as a kid without ever completeing even half of the palaces in the game.  I did revisit and beat the game as an adult, but that was after I knew where to go and what to do, so it just didn't give me that same sense of satisfaction of doing it on my own.  The speedrun can be fun to watch to a point, but it looks just as frustrating as playing the game casually so I want no part of it.</p>
